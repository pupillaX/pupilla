# About Pupilla

The site's name takes inspiration from a term used by Chiara Lubich: "[…] la Ferita dell'Abbandono che è la pupilla dell'Occhio di Dio sul mondo: un Vuoto Infinito attraverso il quale Dio guarda noi: la finestra di Dio spalancata sul mondo e la finestra dell'umanità attraverso la quale si vede Dio" (P'49 §415). The name also references other meanings or connotations: "pupil" as student, since being students puts us all on the same level, ready to discover together the "beyond that is already here"; pupus or pupa, the latin roots meaning little boy or little girl, which also relate to the Trent dialect of popo or popa with the same meaning of little boy or girl, a term used by Lubich affectionately to refer to those who lived like evangelical children and in particular her companions and followers who shared her ideal of unity.

All experiences shape who we are, how we think, how we see the world – through what lens we observe it – and how we interact with it. Building on our domains of expertise, whether scientific, philosophical or theological, each with their own language, domain and methods, we wish to provide a space to share long-form essays, analyses or research in a variety of fields in pursuit of sharing discovered beauty rooted in or inspired by the spirituality of unity.

This site then will contain articles – mostly pre-prints – that have not undergone peer-review yet but that have been found to be valuable and worthwhile. Note that It may include content primarily in English, Italian, Spanish and Catalan but is open to others. Each article will be presented with a brief abstract, the article itself in PDF (in more languages if available) and a possibility to post comments or questions on this site or contact the authors of the article directly in case of interest.
