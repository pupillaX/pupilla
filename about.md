### Our Mission

Pupilla is a curated multidisciplinary preprint archive dedicated to fostering scholarly dialogue and research inspired by the desire to build bridges of fraternal relationships among individuals, between cultural groups and in every area of society. We provide a platform where researchers from diverse fields can share their work, insights, and discoveries in pursuit of knowledge that bridges disciplines, cultures, and perspectives.

### Our Vision

We believe that all experiences shape who we are, how we think, how we see the world, and how we interact with it. Building on diverse experiences and expertise—whether scientific, philosophical, theological, or artistic—each with their own language, domain, and methods, we seek to create a space for sharing long-form essays, analyses, and research across multiple disciplines.

Our vision is rooted in the conviction that knowledge flourishes when shared across traditional boundaries. We aspire to demonstrate that academic rigor and spiritual insight can complement each other, creating new pathways for understanding our world and our place within it.

### The name "pupilla"

The site’s name is the multisemic word “pupilla”, which is Latin for pupil. It can mean that empty opening in the eye through which the world enters our senses and mind, emphasising the importance of self–emptying and making space so that the other may be welcomed. It is an interface that is not so as to allow for connection. The concept was central to Chiara Lubich’s understanding of how God and the world see each other, where it is Jesus in his forsakenness on the cross who is that pupil.

The word also shares a root with the English “pupil” meaning student, recognizing that we are all learners, positioned to seek understanding together. It also shares an origin with the Latin “pupus” or “pupa”, meaning little boy or girl and echoing the affectionately evangelical invitation to be like children.
