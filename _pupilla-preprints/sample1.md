  This paper examines Chiara Lubich's radical reinterpretation of Jesus' promise in Matthew 18:20: "For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them." Drawing from Lubich's mystical insights during the "Paradise of '49" and her extensive talks spanning several decades, the study analyzes her revolutionary understanding of who can experience Christ's presence and under what conditions. Lubich's interpretation challenges traditional ecclesiastical boundaries by proposing that Jesus deliberately left the identity of the "two or three" anonymous, extending the possibility of divine encounter beyond conventional religious categories. Through analysis of her writings and speeches to diverse audiences—from Catholic bishops to Muslim communities and Buddhist teachers—the paper demonstrates that Lubich envisioned "anyone" as potentially capable of experiencing Christ's presence, regardless of denominational affiliation, age, or social status. However, this universal accessibility is coupled with demanding spiritual requirements. Lubich insists that Christ's presence manifests only through reciprocal love modeled after Jesus' complete self-emptying—a love willing to extend to the point of death. The paper explores this paradox between universal possibility and rigorous conditions, revealing how Lubich's vision offers a theological foundation for authentic interfaith dialogue. The study concludes that while Lubich's "two or three" can include people of various faiths and ages, the essential requirement remains constant: mutual love characterized by total self-sacrifice. This interpretation provides a pathway for experiencing shared divine presence that depends not on formal religious identity but on the transformative quality of human relationships
