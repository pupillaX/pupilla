### Our Mission

Pupilla is a multidisciplinary preprint archive dedicated to fostering scholarly dialogue and research inspired by the spirituality of unity. We provide a platform where researchers from diverse fields can share their work, insights, and discoveries in pursuit of knowledge that bridges disciplines, cultures, and perspectives.

### The Name "Pupilla"

The site's name takes inspiration from a profound term used by Chiara Lubich: "[…] la Ferita dell'Abbandono che è la pupilla dell'Occhio di Dio sul mondo: un Vuoto Infinito attraverso il quale Dio guarda noi: la finestra di Dio spalancata sul mondo e la finestra dell'umanità attraverso la quale si vede Dio" (P'49 §415).

The name also embraces multiple layers of meaning: "Pupil" as student – recognizing that we are all learners, positioned equally to discover together the "beyond that is already here". "Pupus" or "pupa" – from Latin roots meaning little boy or little girl, echoing the Trent dialect terms "popo" or "popa" that Lubich used affectionately for those who lived like evangelical children, particularly her companions who shared the ideal of unity

### Our Vision

We believe that all experiences shape who we are, how we think, how we see the world, and how we interact with it. Building on diverse experiences and expertise—whether scientific, philosophical, theological, or artistic—each with their own language, domain, and methods, we seek to create a space for sharing long-form essays, analyses, and research across multiple disciplines.

Our vision is rooted in the conviction that knowledge flourishes when shared across traditional boundaries. We aspire to demonstrate that academic rigor and spiritual insight can complement each other, creating new pathways for understanding our world and our place within it.
